%%%% Background
@article{Flaxman2020,
abstract = {Following the detection of the new coronavirus1 severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and its spread outside of China, Europe has experienced large epidemics of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). In response, many European countries have implemented non-pharmaceutical interventions, such as the closure of schools and national lockdowns. Here we study the effect of major interventions across 11 European countries for the period from the start of the COVID-19 epidemics in February 2020 until 4 May 2020, when lockdowns started to be lifted. Our model calculates backwards from observed deaths to estimate transmission that occurred several weeks previously, allowing for the time lag between infection and death. We use partial pooling of information between countries, with both individual and shared effects on the time-varying reproduction number (Rt). Pooling allows for more information to be used, helps to overcome idiosyncrasies in the data and enables more-timely estimates. Our model relies on fixed estimates of some epidemiological parameters (such as the infection fatality rate), does not include importation or subnational variation and assumes that changes in Rt are an immediate response to interventions rather than gradual changes in behaviour. Amidst the ongoing pandemic, we rely on death data that are incomplete, show systematic biases in reporting and are subject to future consolidation. We estimate that?for all of the countries we consider here?current interventions have been sufficient to drive Rt below 1 (probability Rt {\textless} 1.0 is greater than 99{\%}) and achieve control of the epidemic. We estimate that across all 11 countries combined, between 12 and 15 million individuals were infected with SARS-CoV-2 up to 4 May 2020, representing between 3.2{\%} and 4.0{\%} of the population. Our results show that major non-pharmaceutical interventions?and lockdowns in particular?have had a large effect on reducing transmission. Continued intervention should be considered to keep transmission of SARS-CoV-2 under control.},

@article{Mellan2020,
abstract = {Brazil is an epicentre for COVID-19 in Latin America. In this report we describe the Brazilian epidemic using three epidemiological measures: the number of infections, the number of deaths and the reproduction number. Our modelling framework requires sufficient death data to estimate trends, and we therefore limit our analysis to 16 states that have experienced a total of more than fifty deaths. The distribution of deaths among states is highly heterogeneous, with 5 states$\backslash$---|Sao Paulo, Rio de Janeiro, Ceara, Pernambuco and Amazonas$\backslash$---|accounting for 81{\%} of deaths reported to date. In these states, we estimate that the percentage of people that have been infected with SARS-CoV-2 ranges from 3.3{\%} (95{\%} CI: 2.8{\%}-3.7{\%}) in Sao Paulo to 10.6{\%} (95{\%} CI: 8.8{\%}-12.1{\%}) in Amazonas. The reproduction number (a measure of transmission intensity) at the start of the epidemic meant that an infected individual would infect three or four others on average. Following non-pharmaceutical interventions such as school closures and decreases in population mobility, we show that the reproduction number has dropped substantially in each state. However, for all 16 states we study, we estimate with high confidence that the reproduction number remains above 1. A reproduction number above 1 means that the epidemic is not yet controlled and will continue to grow. These trends are in stark contrast to other major COVID-19 epidemics in Europe and Asia where enforced lockdowns have successfully driven the reproduction number below 1. While the Brazilian epidemic is still relatively nascent on a national scale, our results suggest that further action is needed to limit spread and prevent health system overload. {\#}{\#}{\#} Competing Interest Statement The authors have declared no competing interest. {\#}{\#}{\#} Funding Statement This work used the Cirrus UK National Tier-2 HPC Service at EPCC (http://www.cirrus.ac.uk) funded by the University of Edinburgh and EPSRC (EP/P020267/1).

@article{Verity2020,
abstract = {Background: In the face of rapidly changing data, a range of case fatality ratio estimates for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) have been produced that differ substantially in magnitude. We aimed to provide robust estimates, accounting for censoring and ascertainment biases. Methods: We collected individual-case data for patients who died from COVID-19 in Hubei, mainland China (reported by national and provincial health commissions to Feb 8, 2020), and for cases outside of mainland China (from government or ministry of health websites and media reports for 37 countries, as well as Hong Kong and Macau, until Feb 25, 2020). These individual-case data were used to estimate the time between onset of symptoms and outcome (death or discharge from hospital). We next obtained age-stratified estimates of the case fatality ratio by relating the aggregate distribution of cases to the observed cumulative deaths in China, assuming a constant attack rate by age and adjusting for demography and age-based and location-based under-ascertainment. We also estimated the case fatality ratio from individual line-list data on 1334 cases identified outside of mainland China. Using data on the prevalence of PCR-confirmed cases in international residents repatriated from China, we obtained age-stratified estimates of the infection fatality ratio. Furthermore, data on age-stratified severity in a subset of 3665 cases from China were used to estimate the proportion of infected individuals who are likely to require hospitalisation. Findings: Using data on 24 deaths that occurred in mainland China and 165 recoveries outside of China, we estimated the mean duration from onset of symptoms to death to be 17{\textperiodcentered}8 days (95{\%} credible interval [CrI] 16{\textperiodcentered}9?19{\textperiodcentered}2) and to hospital discharge to be 24{\textperiodcentered}7 days (22{\textperiodcentered}9?28{\textperiodcentered}1). In all laboratory confirmed and clinically diagnosed cases from mainland China (n=70 117), we estimated a crude case fatality ratio (adjusted for censoring) of 3{\textperiodcentered}67{\%} (95{\%} CrI 3{\textperiodcentered}56?3{\textperiodcentered}80). However, after further adjusting for demography and under-ascertainment, we obtained a best estimate of the case fatality ratio in China of 1{\textperiodcentered}38{\%} (1{\textperiodcentered}23?1{\textperiodcentered}53), with substantially higher ratios in older age groups (0{\textperiodcentered}32{\%} [0{\textperiodcentered}27?0{\textperiodcentered}38] in those aged {\textless}60 years vs 6{\textperiodcentered}4{\%} [5{\textperiodcentered}7?7{\textperiodcentered}2] in those aged ?60 years), up to 13{\textperiodcentered}4{\%} (11{\textperiodcentered}2?15{\textperiodcentered}9) in those aged 80 years or older. Estimates of case fatality ratio from international cases stratified by age were consistent with those from China (parametric estimate 1{\textperiodcentered}4{\%} [0{\textperiodcentered}4?3{\textperiodcentered}5] in those aged {\textless}60 years [n=360] and 4{\textperiodcentered}5{\%} [1{\textperiodcentered}8?11{\textperiodcentered}1] in those aged ?60 years [n=151]). Our estimated overall infection fatality ratio for China was 0{\textperiodcentered}66{\%} (0{\textperiodcentered}39?1{\textperiodcentered}33), with an increasing profile with age. Similarly, estimates of the proportion of infected individuals likely to be hospitalised increased with age up to a maximum of 18{\textperiodcentered}4{\%} (11{\textperiodcentered}0?37{\textperiodcentered}6) in those aged 80 years or older. Interpretation: These early estimates give an indication of the fatality ratio across the spectrum of COVID-19 disease and show a strong age gradient in risk of death.

@article{Ferguson2020,
abstract = {The global impact of COVID-19 has been profound, and the public health threat it represents is the most serious seen in a respiratory virus since the 1918 H1N1 influenza pandemic. Here we present the results of epidemiological modelling which has informed policymaking in the UK and other countries in recent weeks. In the absence of a COVID-19 vaccine, we assess the potential role of a number of public health measures ‚Äì so-called non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) ‚Äì aimed at reducing contact rates in the population and thereby reducing transmission of the virus. In the results presented here, we apply a previously published microsimulation model to two countries: the UK (Great Britain specifically) and the US. We conclude that the effectiveness of any one intervention in isolation is likely to be limited, requiring multiple interventions to be combined to have a substantial impact on transmission. Two fundamental strategies are possible: (a) mitigation, which focuses on slowing but not necessarily stopping epidemic spread ‚Äì reducing peak healthcare demand while protecting those most at risk of severe disease from infection, and (b) suppression, which aims to reverse epidemic growth, reducing case numbers to low levels and maintaining that situation indefinitely. Each policy has major challenges. We find that that optimal mitigation policies (combining home isolation of suspect cases, home quarantine of those living in the same household as suspect cases, and social distancing of the elderly and others at most risk of severe disease) might reduce peak healthcare demand by 2/3 and deaths by half. However, the resulting mitigated epidemic would still likely result in hundreds of thousands of deaths and health systems (most notably intensive care units) being overwhelmed many times over. For countries able to achieve it, this leaves suppression as the preferred policy option. We show that in the UK and US context, suppression will minimally require a combination of social distancing of the entire population, home isolation of cases and household quarantine of their family members. This may need to be supplemented by school and university closures, though it should be recognised that such closures may have negative impacts on health systems due to increased absenteeism. The major challenge of suppression is that this type of intensive intervention package ‚Äì or something equivalently effective at reducing transmission ‚Äì will need to be maintained until a vaccine becomes available (potentially 18 months or more) ‚Äì given that we predict that transmission will quickly rebound if interventions are relaxed. We show that intermittent social distancing ‚Äì triggered by trends in disease surveillance ‚Äì may allow interventions to be relaxed temporarily in relative short time windows, but measures will need to be reintroduced if or when case numbers rebound. Last, while experience in China and now South Korea show that suppression is possible in the short term, it remains to be seen whether it is possible long-term, and whether the social and economic costs of the interventions adopted thus far can be reduced.},

@article{Bi2020,
abstract = {Background: Rapid spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in Wuhan, China, prompted heightened surveillance in Shenzhen, China. The resulting data provide a rare opportunity to measure key metrics of disease course, transmission, and the impact of control measures. Methods: From Jan 14 to Feb 12, 2020, the Shenzhen Center for Disease Control and Prevention identified 391 SARS-CoV-2 cases and 1286 close contacts. We compared cases identified through symptomatic surveillance and contact tracing, and estimated the time from symptom onset to confirmation, isolation, and admission to hospital. We estimated metrics of disease transmission and analysed factors influencing transmission risk. Findings: Cases were older than the general population (mean age 45 years) and balanced between males (n=187) and females (n=204). 356 (91{\%}) of 391 cases had mild or moderate clinical severity at initial assessment. As of Feb 22, 2020, three cases had died and 225 had recovered (median time to recovery 21 days; 95{\%} CI 20‚Äì22). Cases were isolated on average 4{\textperiodcentered}6 days (95{\%} CI 4{\textperiodcentered}1‚Äì5{\textperiodcentered}0) after developing symptoms; contact tracing reduced this by 1{\textperiodcentered}9 days (95{\%} CI 1{\textperiodcentered}1‚Äì2{\textperiodcentered}7). Household contacts and those travelling with a case were at higher risk of infection (odds ratio 6{\textperiodcentered}27 [95{\%} CI 1{\textperiodcentered}49‚Äì26{\textperiodcentered}33] for household contacts and 7{\textperiodcentered}06 [1{\textperiodcentered}43‚Äì34{\textperiodcentered}91] for those travelling with a case) than other close contacts. The household secondary attack rate was 11{\textperiodcentered}2{\%} (95{\%} CI 9{\textperiodcentered}1‚Äì13{\textperiodcentered}8), and children were as likely to be infected as adults (infection rate 7{\textperiodcentered}4{\%} in children {\textless}10 years vs population average of 6{\textperiodcentered}6{\%}). The observed reproductive number (R) was 0{\textperiodcentered}4 (95{\%} CI 0{\textperiodcentered}3‚Äì0{\textperiodcentered}5), with a mean serial interval of 6{\textperiodcentered}3 days (95{\%} CI 5{\textperiodcentered}2‚Äì7{\textperiodcentered}6). Interpretation: Our data on cases as well as their infected and uninfected close contacts provide key insights into the epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2. This analysis shows that isolation and contact tracing reduce the time during which cases are infectious in the community, thereby reducing the R. The overall impact of isolation and contact tracing, however, is uncertain and highly dependent on the number of asymptomatic cases. Moreover, children are at a similar risk of infection to the general population, although less likely to have severe symptoms; hence they should be considered in analyses of transmission and control.

abstract = {This document describes the aggregation and anonymization process applied to the initial version of Google COVID-19 Community Mobility Reports (published at http://google.com/covid19/mobility on April 2, 2020), a publicly available resource intended to help public health authorities understand what has changed in response to work-from-home, shelter-in-place, and other recommended policies aimed at flattening the curve of the COVID-19 pandemic. Our anonymization process is designed to ensure that no personal data, including an individual's location, movement, or contacts, can be derived from the resulting metrics. The high-level description of the procedure is as follows: we first generate a set of anonymized metrics from the data of Google users who opted in to Location History. Then, we compute percentage changes of these metrics from a baseline based on the historical part of the anonymized metrics. We then discard a subset which does not meet our bar for statistical reliability, and release the rest publicly in a format that compares the result to the private baseline.},
